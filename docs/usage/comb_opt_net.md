To run CombOptNet experiments, move into the `external/comboptnet` folder. Then launch the script `main.py` using the 
YAML configuration file as argument. Inside the `external/comboptnet/experiments` folder you can find the configuration
files for the KP with stochastic capacity, KP with stochastic weights and the WSMC.
