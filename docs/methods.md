These are the DFL methods available:

- [x] **Prediction-focused learning**. Actually, this is not a DFL method and it involves the training of a ML model for maximum 
accuracy. The model trained is then used to make predictions in the optimization model.
- [x] **Smart Predict-then-optimize**. Implementation of the method described in the paper [[1]](#1).
- [x] **Blackbox**. Implementation of the method described in the paper [[2]](#2).
- [x] **Self-contrastive estimation**. Implementation of the Self-contrastive estimation method described in the paper 
[[3]](#3).
- [x] **DPO (Fenchel-Young loss)**. Learning with Differentiable Perturbed Optimizers [[4]](#4).
- [x] **Score function gradient estimation**. The method we are proposing in the current paper.
